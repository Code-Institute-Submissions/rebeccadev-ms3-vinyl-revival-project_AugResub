# Vinyl Revival 
## MS3 Code institute project 

![Wireframes preview](readme_documentation/images/responsivepreview.png)


Vinyl Revival has been created for my MS3 project with the code institute. Users of the website will be able to register, create a profile and upload their record collection. In addition they will be able to view other records
within the community collection and search records that have been uploaded. The website will build upon existing skills within HTML, CSS and 
Javascript, and utilize new skills learned within Python, Jinja, using the 
Flask framework and Mongodb.

## UX
 
### Aims

**Site owner's goal**

To build a community where vinyl is celebrated and can be reviewed. 

**External userâ€™s goal** 

Use the website to share vinyl collections and leave reviews on other collections.


 
#### User Stories
As a user I want to be able to:


> -  *Use the site with ease on mobile, tablet and pc devices.*
> -  *View records uploaded by the community*.
> -  *Add my favourite vinyl records to the website*
> -  *Delete records from my collection*
> -  *View my vinyl collection on my profile page.*
> - *Highlight which records are favourites.*
> - *Search records within the database.*


As an Admin user I want to be able to:


> -  *Add vinyl records to my own profile page.*
> -  *Add, edit and delete genres of music.*


## Scope

Due to time contraints I opted to make an MVP where CRUD functionality exists
for both users and admin users.

General user 
> - Create - Add a record to their personal collection
> - Edit - Edit and update records that they have added.
> - Delete - Delete records that they have added to their collection.

Admin users also have additional crud fuctoinality.
> - Create genre
> - Edit and update genres
> - Delete genres

In addition the project will also include a search feature.

Phase two of the project would add the following elements.

>- Pagination - as the database expands pagination will be important, particuarly on mobile devices.

>- Having the option to pre-fill the image url with a default image if the user didn't want to upload
an image. 

Both parts of phase two would help to improve the UX design.


### Skeleton

#### Database

The db will consist of four collections, users, record, genres and review.

* The review collection was created to provide more indepth reviews of records.
Due to time constraints rating was used instead. I would like to expand on
this in the future to provide written reviews.

#### Wireframes

Wireframes have been created using a mobile first approach. 
Please [click here](readmedocumentation/pdf/wireframes.pdf) to view the PDF showing full wireframes for the site.

### Surface
I have taken on inspiration from gaming websites such as the Oculus website. I feel the simple colour scheme
of black, white and grey makes for a modern and clean look for the website. 


**Colours**

![colour scheme](https://github.com/rebeccadev/ms3-vinyl-revival-project/blob/master/readme_documentation/images/coolors.png?raw=true)

I wanted to make a modern design, utilising a monochrome colour palette. White space has also been used to provide a sense of calm.

I have used (#ffffff) for my main text to make the typography contrasting and clear to the user against the white background. 
and have used (#000000) and (#ffffff) for my text within the footer section to stand out against the grey background. 

**Typography**


**Heading text**

The font Oswald has been used for headings - this font works well as it is bold, modern and contrats well against the body text. 

**Body text**

Chivo has been used for the body text, this sans serif font is clearly legible to the user, especially on mobile devices. It also contrasts nicely
against the heading font.


**Imagery**

Unsplash has been used for all the photography within the website. I chose modern images that would fit with
the colour palette and provide a modern feel to the website. 

**Cards**

I have decided to use the card component within Materialize to display the data from the records. I feel this works well and emulates physically turning over a record to see the tracklisting and it can also showcase the vinyl album artwork well.

## Testing

 ## Problems and solutions

### Design 
 - Card sizing
 I had problems with card sizing initally during the project. To ensure all card sizing was
 uniform I used the Materialize size class options

### Crud functionality

Delete function 

- During the development process I discovered that my delete functionality wasn't working correctly.
When clicking delete on an album it would delete the first record the user added rather than the specific album that the user wanted to delete. I found the modal to be the cause of this issue. 
To resolve it a unique reference to the modal ID was needed. I opted to use loop.index to ensure it was unique.

## Deployment

## Cloning the repository
To clone the repository the following steps need to be taken.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click the green Clone or download Button under the repository name.
3. Open Git Bash. 
4. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory. 
5. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. 
6. Press enter to create the local clone.

### Run locally
1. Type pip3 install -r requirements.txt in the CLI to install the modules listed in the requirements.txt file.
2.  Create a database in mongodb and copy the following collections "users" "genres" "record" "review"
3. In the root directory of your project, create an env.py file and add it to your .gitignore file.This is where sensitive information will be held so we need to ensure it isn't pushed to the repo.
Copy the content below to link up the database.

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "secret_key")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "mongo_uri")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "mongo_dbname")
```


### Deploying to Heroku

1. Use command pip3 freeze --local> requirements.txt to create a requirements
file that collects all of the required dependancies. 
2. Within the root directory create a procfile and enter web: python app.py > Procfile
Enter the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
3. Push the requirements.txt and Procfile to the repository. 
4. Log in to Heroku and click the link for create a new app. Ensure the name
for the app is unique.
5. Within Heroku locate the Deploy tab. Within the deployment method click on Github.
6. Search for the repository name and click connect.
7. Locate the settings tab and click Reveal Config Vars
8. Add the following variables: 
- IP: 0.0.0.0.
- PORT: 5000
-SECRET_KEY
- MONGO_URI
- MONGO_DBNAME: vinyl_collector
9. Click on deploy branch. After it is built you will see the message "Your App was successfully deployed"
10. Click "view to launch the app" 


## Credits

### Website Inspiration
- I have taken inspiration from the Oculus website. The monochrome colour palette and alot
of whitespace make for a modern feel which I wanted to emulate within my site.
