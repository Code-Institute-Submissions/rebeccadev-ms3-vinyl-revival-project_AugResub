Vinyl Revival




Vinyl Revival has been created for my MS3 project with the code institute. Users of the website will be able to register, create a profile and upload their
record collection. In addition they will be able to view other records and have the ability to leave reviews.

## UX
 
### Aims

**Site owner's goal**

To build a community where vinyl is celebrated and can be reviewed. 

**External user’s goal** 

Use the website to share vinyl collections and leave reviews on other collections.


 
#### User Stories
As a user I want to be able to:


> -  *Use the site with ease on mobile, tablet and pc devices.*
> -  *View records uploaded by the community*.
> -  *Add my favourite vinyl records to the website*
> -  *View my vinyl collection on my profile page.*
> - *Highlight which records are favourites.*
> - *Search records within the database.*


As an Admin user I want to be able to:


> -  *Add vinyl records to my own profile page.*
> -  *Add, edit and delete genres of music.*


### Skeleton

### Surface
I have taken on inspiration from gaming websites such as the Oculus website. I feel the simple colour scheme
of black, white and grey makes for a modern and clean look for the website. 


**Colours**

White space has been used to provide a sense of calm,

I have used (#ffffff) for my main text to make the typography contrasting and clear to the user against the white background. 
and have used (#000000) and (#ffffff) for my text within the footer section to stand out against the grey background. 

**Typography**


**Heading text**

The font Oswald has been used for headings - this font works well as it is bold, modern and contrats well against the body text. 

**Body text**

Chivo has been used for the body text, this sans serif font is clearly legible to the user, especially on mobile devices. It also contrasts nicely
against the heading font.


**Imagery**

Unsplash has been used for all the photography within the website. I chose modern images that would fit with
the colour palette and provide a modern feel to the website.
